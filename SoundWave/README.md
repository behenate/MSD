# Lab 2 - Sound Wave

### A simple sound wave simulation using a Cellular Automaton

There are three kinds of placeable cells:

- White cells - Create a sound wave in the first iteration and then disappear
- Red cells - Represent a wall that the sound can't pass
- Green cells - send out a sound wave periodically
