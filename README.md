# Modelling of Discrete Systems
This repository contains my solutions to the following handouts from Modelling of Discrete Systems course on AGH UST:

*Note: parts of the code were created by the teachers. Most often we were tasked with implementations of the algotighms and some UI changes *

# Lab 1 - Game Of Life and Rain

### Game of life

Classic cellular automaton problem.

Features:

- The user can place cells before and during the simulation
- The game of life has a couple of different rule sets that can be changed during the simulation

### Rain Simulation

Application creates a simple rain simulation using cellular automaton.

### A demo of the application:

# Lab 2 - Sound Wave

### A simple sound wave simulation using a Cellular Automaton

There are three kinds of placeable cells:

- White cells - Create a sound wave in the first iteration and then disappear
- Red cells - Represent a wall that the sound can't pass
- Green cells - send out a sound wave periodically
